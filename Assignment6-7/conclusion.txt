The pragmas that were the most effective in reducing resource utilization was HLS
ARRAY_PARTITION and HLS ALLOCATE. While ALLOCATE minimized resource usage, it 
increased the latency, so I added two solutions, one with ALLOCATE and one without.

The pragma that was the most effective for timing performance was HLS PIPELINE.
