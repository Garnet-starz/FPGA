# FPGA
This is a repository for all of my assignments for this class starting with assignment 3.
# Folder Contents
I have added a folder for each assignment. Within each folder is the source code, the header file, the test bench along with any reference data, and the csynthesis report for each question within the assignment. Also, for assignments where the questions asked for a short answer response, there is a file within those assignment folders called "conclusion.txt," in which I wrote my response.
